A：Hey,how are you?

B:Well,it’s not so good!

A:what’s wrong with you ,mate?

B:I just can’t sleep well for two days and I feel tired!

A:why don’t you go to doctor timely?

B: I thought it will be better soon,but the thing went wrong with what i thought.

A: I think you should eat more fruit and vegetables,and try to do some exercise. What’s more , before you sleep you could take a shower so that you can have a better sleep!

B: Thanks for your advice , I’ll try it.

A;You are welcome.
